        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Slice the mushrooms
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat some oil on a medium pan and lightly fry mushrooms until tender on medium heat.  Remove mushrooms and set aside.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Chop the onions and weep
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add more oil to the pan and add 1/3 of the onions to the pan and lightly fry until translucent.  And the next third and fry until that third is translucent, then add the final third and fry unti that third is just slightly golden brown.  You now have three levels of onions - carmelized and melting into the sauce, lightly carmelize and tender, and sweet and crunchy.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Chop garlic
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Add garlic, tomato basil sauce (I like Trader Joe's), and mushrooms to the pan and stir, along with salt, pepper, and chili flakes.  Turn the heat down to low and simmer (At this point, you can add whatever other spices you like)
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Boil a pot of water 3/4 full on high until water reaches a rolling boil. Add pasta and set to cook for 8 minutes, or just a few minutes before it would be al dente depending on brand (I use Trader Joe's Brown Rice and Quinoa pasta).
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Drain pasta and rinse with cold water to prevent overcooking and sticking
    </p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Add pasta to sauce, mix thoroughly, and turn heat up to medium, allowing pasta to finish cooking by absorbing water from the sauce.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Grate equal piles of parmesian and pecorino romano and mix, to top pasta. You can also add more chili flakes to individual plates at this point.  Serve your hungry family!

                    <td>Low-Sugar Fruit Spread of Choice (for my recipe for healthy, protein-filled, zero-added-sugar jam, I will be demanding ritual sacrifice.  Or you can use organic raspberry fruit spread from Trader Joe's and it won't have as much sugar as regular jam, although no protein)</td>
                    <td>1 cup</td>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Melt the chocolate, either in a double boiler or in the microwave (carefully, so it does not burn. Stir every 30 seconds)
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stir jam into the chocolate uniformly
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour into a lined container, cover, and chill in the fridge until solid.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove from fridge and cut into small squares.  This treat is rich and fudgey, so even small squares are satisfying.
